## Overview

The Interactive Meditation Guide is a web-based platform designed to offer guided meditations paired with interactive, calming animations. This platform allows users to select meditation themes based on their needsâ€”whether it's stress relief, focus, or relaxation. As users follow the guided audio, the screen displays animations that synchronize with the meditation progress, creating an immersive experience that enhances mindfulness.
